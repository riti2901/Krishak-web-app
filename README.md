Problem:
There is a lack of a centralized platform for farmers and landowners to connect and collaborate.

Research:
After COVID-19 rural unemployment has increased sharply to around 7.7%.
Large percentages of landowners do not have the latest knowledge regarding efficient farming techniques

Solution:
Creating a dynamic interface to connect farmers and landowners and providing them with a centralized platform to collaborate.
1)Easy to contact landowners
2)Easy to find potential farmers
3)Can get expert guidance anytime
